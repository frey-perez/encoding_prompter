SPEAKERS
TH-001, PA-001

TH-001  
Okay, we're recording. So yeah, just, I'm gonna turn my phone on airplane mode in case someone rings me. Okay, so just tell me about your experience, very open ended.

PA-001  
So what, visuals, or?

TH-001  
Just from start to finish, the whole thing, different things come through your head, how it went.

PA-001  
I seemed very concentrated and locked in, with, it helps with the mask and the music, the music was a lot more intense, a lot more intense than normal. That was very clear. It was quite nice. It felt a bit more emotion in it, visually, nice, funky, kind of smoky swirls, but not much. And then it was a couple of picture visuals. But then I started to try and bring it back and think about my and just kept going over everything, I think. Is that what you want to know. 

TH-001  
Yeah, yeah. Keep going yeah. So just the whole thing, just in general.

PA-001  
That is very open ended, I need to dial it down to something.

TH-001  
No, just I just want to see what what you want to say about it. Just talk freely about everything that sort of you feel about yesterday. What you like, what you didn't like, what happened? 

PA-001  
There's no bits I didn't like.

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
I wasn't, I wasn't, I didn't feel like tricked by the psychedelics at all, the small amount, didn't seem it wasn't fazed by it or scared from it. And it was quite relaxing as well, the whole quite submerged into it. I felt like I could have gone deeper into the thought of it. But I was trying to let it go rather than guiding it down somewhere. So I didn't I don't think I had any revelations as it was. But when when we said how to be a better husband, how to be a better father. The one thing I did realize is that they're both the same, to me. I think they're both the same. And then when, yeah, when I was thinking, how could I be a better father? or how will I be, and a better husband? I thought I need to give more, just do things give more to , and maybe, and then I'll get more back. And then I kind of a little bit of guilt came in. Because I thought oh, that's that's not selfless. That's doing it for me, which was really hard, which was really hard. And then I started to think about guilt within our relationship as it was. I just thought oh that's that's not selfless then, that's, but it's it's okay, guilt, do you get what I mean?

TH-001  
Yeah. 

PA-001  
So it's, it's not coming from a bad place. It's, the receiving back is consequential from giving. And if that happens to make you feel good then good, you should do it. It's only going to enhance our relationship as a family. So yeah, I think that's thoughts wise. And my stepsister popped up, which was odd, because it's not always been plain sailing. She's a younger sibling. And it's been, it's been a bit of friction there, because I'm like taking, her and her sister very close, and I've been taking her away. And there's a bit of a bit of resentment there, and her to be fiance I think, is very, very, is a bit of a cock really, if I'm honest, and no one likes him. So there's this this double standard between <PERSON>, so I think she's a bit __ that double standard. It really, really frustrates me. So I've got a bit of a beef with her, but I'm always told to shut up so.

TH-001  
With the sister? Yeah, and everyone's got to do, she sets the mood for everybody, which really annoys me. And like I'm really I'm really proud of <PERSON>, because she's just amazing, everything that she's done with the business and stuff. So I don't think she gets justified credit. So I like trying, not overcompensate, but I try and give her the comfort and attention and drive that she needs.  That's good.

PA-001  
So yeah, I wasn't expecting <PERSON> to pop up but it was only a fleeting kind of, oh okay, um, 

TH-001  
What was the fleeting, what, what exactly was that sort of?

PA-001  
So, her boyfriend's been going on oh, you need to come to us for Christmas this year. And it's a big thing in the Jones household for Christmas. It's a big thing. And that's where I went down. Because my mom and dad, mom and stepdad went to <LOCATION> to see my sister. And I was like, Oh, well I'm not coming home for Christmas then am I, because it'd just be me sitting around the Christmas tree on my own then, opening no presents. So I went down to them. And then for the last four years, I've gone down and I love it down there. It's great. I get on with my grandparents, both sides and ___. But it's always been like, why are you here type thing. And this year, I know she's going to go

TH-001  
From <PERSON> or from her sister, sorry?

PA-001  
Just her, yeah. And I know this year, just from a few comments I've heard. I think he's going to propose to her. And she's going there for Christmas. But she's not told anyone yet. And it just it tweaked in my mind. He's going to propose to her. And it's just again, it's double standards, and that I believe me, I think that was the connection from <PERSON> to <PERSON>. And then the point of what I'm telling you is, just be happy for her. And like, yeah, I just I'll just, you know, you're an adult, you're not a child. Like, it's gonna be it's gonna happen. Don't resist. Just just let it happen.

TH-001  
Yeah. Let go. 

PA-001  
So that was maybe, so maybe that was the second realization I had. And that was about it, really. I kind of found that after the second session, I felt like it was done. I was like, there's no more. There's no more to achieve here. But I just kind of went back into it. And there was no real--

TH-001  
By second session you mean the second EEG?

PA-001  
So first hour, second hour. But I got into the third one, I was like, I'm on the wind down now. And my analytical brain kicking in there. I was just like, there's no more to be had here. And like at that point, I almost wanted it to like, ramp up big time. Because I felt like I wanted to get into the weeds of it. Big time, which was really hard. Do you know what I mean, like, it's not like, Oh, I'll have one more spliff. No, I wanted to like, full full go into it. Without sounding a bit cliche, I just wanted to kind of blast off into it. Because at first I was I was maybe a bit anxious because I was scared it was just going to spit me out the other side. But I really started to like, enjoy, just maybe the mildness and the comfortable, the comfort of it, shall I say. 

TH-001  
So let me sum up to make sure I have everything correct. So there was nothing from the day you didn't like, which was great. 

PA-001  
I didn't like the EEG.

TH-001  
Did you not?

PA-001  
God, no. It was like a medieval torture.

TH-001  
All of it or just the last bit? Or the first bit?

PA-001  
We should definitely speed up the amount of time that's on my head. I know it's difficult. 

TH-001  
There's no way to do that.

PA-001  
Do it, get it off.

TH-001  
The thing is, people have been like that with the low dose and then said they can't even, they don't even know what's on their head when they're on the high dose.

PA-001  
Well, yeah, it's cuz you're high as balls.

TH-001  
I don't think you'll not like it as much.

PA-001  
No, it's fine. Like it's just, it's done, do you know what I mean?

TH-001  
Yeah, so do you think even, now I'm not talking about the times when we do the task, because it's on for quite a long time. But when it's just, when you're sitting on the bed with it on do you think that's hard as well? That that's too long. 

PA-001  
It's just the length of time stays on your head for.

TH-001  
It's like 10 minutes.

PA-001  
I know, but-- 

TH-001  
Does it feel longer?

PA-001  
I think so. But, I'm a big boy. I can deal with it. I'm not gonna tell you it can't be done. It can be done and it will be done and I'll get used to it. I'll just shave my head for next time.

TH-001  
It's actually yeah, no it is quicker settling whenever people have no hair, which you're actually one of the lucky ones though, because the girls get pretty bad because long hair so they have to--

PA-001  
I don't care about that at all. No yeah, that that was literally the only, at first it was weird adjusting to having <PERSON> the room. Just because you don't know what he's doing. I know he's reading now, it's fine. But I didn't know what he's doing, I don't want to take my blindfold off and just be stark as naked. I don't know! I think next time it won't be any surprise or anything, it won't feel awkward.

TH-001  
So you feel you sort of--

PA-001  
Set and settings is, there's no, there's no real issue there.

TH-001  
And <PERSON> will be there for your next prep and everything as well.

PA-001  
Got a bit warm, but I believe that's natural.

TH-001  
Yeah. It's is.

PA-001  
I was getting like the feeling of getting warm. But I think the room was a bit hot.

TH-001  
Yeah. Yeah, and it was actually warmer than usual. Because the reason, you know the way the doors are quite heavy, and you could hear like the air system? And this room, sort of, it's called isolation. And it's generally like the coldest room in the place, so I'm not too sure why, but for the past, like today, it's pretty warm. And yesterday, it was pretty warm. And I don't really know why.

PA-001  
One thing I did say, I could tell when people come in and out. 

TH-001  
Could you?

PA-001  
I think it was quite nice. Because when I was breathing, I could feel the cold air come through the door and breathe it in.

TH-001  
Could you hear it? Or no? It was always me. By the way. No one else can do the EEG. I'm training up someone at the minute. So next time, I won't be doing that. There'll be someone else in the other room doing the EEG. But obviously, you know what, what way this went, and I knew what you'd be having. So I didn't feel like you would, like I was gonna be needed. So yeah, I had to go across to the EEG.

PA-001  
I didn't feel that like I need two spotters as it were, but yeah, that didn't bother me at all. I knew, I know you were local. It's not like you've gone off. 

TH-001  
Yeah. Okay, that's not gonna happen again anyways.

PA-001  
You came in it was like, ___, cheers.

TH-001  
[Laughs] Yeah, I was thinking about it during the other EEG. 

PA-001  
No, I was absolutely comfortable in it. So, sorry. Go on.

TH-001  
Yeah, no, um, so yeah, sorry, about that but I'm glad it didn't bother you. But yeah, next time anyway, I won't have to be doing that. Which is good for both of us actually. Because it's a bit of a nightmare for me too. But um, yeah, so to summarize, so there wasn't much visually, a bit of smokey, haziness.

PA-001  
Bits and parts.

TH-001  
And a few sort of picture type things. 

PA-001  
A couple of Pikachus popped up. What else? When, when that jungle music came on, that was like, the start of the nice bit for me. 

TH-001  
When was that? 

PA-001  
Second song in second playlist. Second time. 

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
Oh. Or after the classical music stopped. It went into like tribal

TH-001  
Oh, I know the one you mean, yeah

PA-001  
That was when like, out of the fog kind of came, almost like on games where it comes out of the floor and it's got all these like tentacley things, like viney thing, and I felt like that was going to go into something. But it just kind of stayed for bit, then it went. 

TH-001  
Yeah. 

PA-001  
That was, that was and then there was like, synapses firing type. You know when you're like-- So it was a bit of that. And then there was like a really, when I travel to work there's, like, when the sun's coming up, there's, like, the tree line is dark. And then there's like, the orange sun behind it, and I was like oh, lovely. And then it just faded. But it was it was really waves. It was like really came then went for 20 minutes, came back and I felt like it was in cycles. Is that normal?

TH-001  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, people do say that as well. Yeah. People say all different things. So there is no real normal or not normal. But there generally is sometimes consistency between people saying certain things went a certain way like--

PA-001  
I do, towards the end, where I thought it was ramping down, it kind of picked up again. And that was, it was the, I was thinking about the castle. And then there's like, just a really clear, big masonry brick castle wall appearring. And it had like a darkened bit in the middle. And then I said, I want to go through because I thought it was a door and it just opened and then stopped. I was like bollocks, that, I imagine if I was high as balls. That would have been kind of, I think that was an indicator that I was ready to kind of go, do you know what I mean? And like, go down.

TH-001  
I think it's really positive the things that you're saying because I think it's a good way to go into the next one.

PA-001  
Because I think I understand drugs a bit. And it's not like, it's not like I'm just off the street random, even though quite a lot of random people do take drugs, like I feel it prepped me a little bit late. So I don't think it's going to be dead easy. I don't think at all, I think it's gonna be really hard. But I don't think I'll freak out.

TH-001  
You won't, don't worry. Yeah, it's totally, doing it like this is different than doing it out at a rave recreationally and stuff. It's completely, it's completely different. 

PA-001  
You can't do that.

TH-001  
Um, so yeah, I mean, when you're when you're on an inward journey, things can be difficult that maybe you don't want to deal with but it's not like freak out where, you know, it's all a bit much and you're trying to hold it together and you're with lots of people in an environment where it's not necessarily.

PA-001  
Zero distraction. 

TH-001  
It's not like that.

PA-001  
And I think you should, you should be able to delve into your subconscious without embarrassment. I think I said that to you yesterday, like, when you're having a dream, and you make a tit of yourself, and you wake up embarrassed. That's a really odd feeling. I don't know why that happens. Like, yeah. Like, I had a dream last year where I was like, sucking my thumb. And then all my friends were there. I was like, Oh, I woke up really embarrassed. Like, Oh, shit. So that that, put that away. Just, there's no, it's your own, it's your own private story. 

TH-001  
Exactly.

PA-001  
Just read it. 

TH-001  
Exactly. That's the best way to think about it. Best way.

PA-001  
Yeah? No one's gonna judge you for it. And if it if it helps you in any way, even if it doesn't help you just check that thought and push it to one side and pick it up later. 

TH-001  
Exactly. 

PA-001  
Alright mate. Well, you're the expert, you tell me. 

TH-001  
Well, let me summarize for you. We can just to make sure I understand everything. So went through you had so the music sort of became more clear. Did you say it's clear? 

PA-001  
Yeah. 

TH-001  
Yeah. And you enjoyed all of that, so that's good. Two sort of main things came up, one based on your intention. So you realize that the two questions, being a better husband and being a better father weren't necessarily separate, they're related.

PA-001  
Yeah, or they were the same. 

TH-001  
Yeah.

PA-001  
Like, directly.

TH-001  
Yeah, they're the same thing. And then you sort of came to the realization you need to just give more but then that made you think oh, and then I'll get more back and then you felt a bit of guilt. But then you realized there's nothing wrong with feeling good for doing--

PA-001  
Yeah, it's a good guilt, positive guilt. 

TH-001  
Okay. Second thing was your sister in law. And the annoyances there with different things. And then you came to a realization like, you know, it's crap, you know, let it go. I'm an adult, I don't need to be wound up by such crap silliness.

PA-001  
Yeah, just be happy for her. 

TH-001  
Just be happy for her yeah, okay.

PA-001  
That was the main, if I was gonna put it into a sentence that would be key.

TH-001  
That's good. Yeah. And so do you think your intention was a good one?

PA-001  
I don't know if we've done it to death, though.

TH-001  
But do you think your attentions a good one to focus on next time, yeah? I think it should be the same. As long as you haven't picked it apart and it doesn't make sense.

PA-001  
Yeah, I think I think that will evolve into my family more. 

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
So I think that'll be family. 

TH-001  
In general?

PA-001  
Maybe. But I don't think, I think that will come from within on the, whilst I'm trippin.

TH-001  
Any reason any particular issues or just in general do you feel like you haven't done enough, or is there something that's making you feel? 

PA-001  
Oh, because just because my family are a trainwreck. 

TH-001  
Really? Okay. 

PA-001  
Yeah. Like, I am abnormally normal for my family. Like, big time. 

TH-001  
Same. [Laughs]

PA-001  
I'm like the most progressive, liberal, non-nihilist, sociopathic, materialistic of of them. They're just. 

TH-001  
Feels like you're talking about my family. [Laughs]

PA-001  
Yeah? They're just a nightmare, my mom and my sister ___. There's there's a lot of family history there but it's just, I've just pushed away. And <PERSON> doesn't, <PERSON> thinks it's an injustice, what happens with my family and me. I get a lot of stick for not doing x y and zed with my family and there's reasons why I don't really bother. I do father but more than I used to, but like, at what point do you go fucking hell, I need to call it a day, like I can't be arsed with your bullshit. So I've kind of distanced myself. 

TH-001  
Don't share the same sort of views and?

PA-001  
Yeah, they don't really understand anything. And like, and not to be all self righteous, but like, like, none of them are drug takers. My dad was a policeman. And like, they're not very open minded at all. At all, like that, like right wing or anything, but like they just they're, I don't think they're up for like, better improvement. They, they're knobs. They're just self obsessed. And that really annoys me because it's not me.

TH-001  
Have you gotten a lot of flack from them for your own sort of like partying or whatever? Like, has it caused turmoil before, or have they never known?

PA-001  
No.

TH-001  
Never known?

PA-001  
Well they, my mom, yeah, I'm quite open, like, not open open but if it crops up, like they know I was a DJ in <LOCATION> for five years. That comes with a little bit of baggage and my mom found quite a lot of weed in my bedroom when I was like, 17. But that was, I look back on it now and laugh because it's, it's nothing, and I'm getting a master's degree, I dunno, can't be that bad for you. So yeah.

TH-001  
But that's what I mean, did that cause sort of a riff in your relationship? 

PA-001  
No, I think it was just my sister, really. She was a lot of, like, she tried to kill herself twice. It was just a cry for help, I don't think she was intending. But there's a lot of fighting between the two, and the divorce of my mom and dad. I was eight. So it didn't really bother me that much. And like, both--

TH-001  
Is your sister older or younger?

PA-001  
Four years older.

TH-001  
Older? Yeah, yeah. 

PA-001  
So she was at like 12. So it's kind of a peak time for her. They didn't handle it well. Like, all these special milestones in my life where they like, try and take credit for, for me. And like, I always say to them, like, obviously it's hard I would never say it to them. Like I am who I am in spite of you, not because of you. So this has got fuck all to do with you and your parenting, you were terrible parents, really. The only saving grace is that you were there ish. I was very independent. I was not, let's just, all of this is because of me. Everything that I've got and achieved as purely because of me.

TH-001  
Because you worked for it.

PA-001  
Yeah, fucking right. You know, like when, my dad was just like, oh it's the engineers mind, you get it from me. It's like, two years ago, I won a national award for engineering design, which is a big fuck off thing. Like, you know, it's like a kiddies Nobel Prize for engineering. And like, this was all me. Like, holy shit. So I think my family are quite selfish. So I think that will come on. I think it's gonna, I don't know. It's got to.

TH-001  
Good, yeah.

PA-001  
Because you know, I've spent the last eight years going no, I don't want to deal with it. And I think it will always, be family is a family. 

TH-001  
Yeah, it's good to share this sort of thing. Because if it does, it's nice for me to have an idea. So that I can, yeah.

PA-001  
It's a good foundation for you to probe it a little bit.

TH-001  
Well, not even probe it. But be there and know what, what it is. Because sometimes it can be a bit ineffable when you're when you're maybe going through something. So it's nice to know someone knows, and it creates more closeness between, in terms of our relationship for you feeling comfortable around me and all. Knowing I know you and the different things that could come up.

PA-001  
So I think, yeah, so like, <PERSON>'s beef with my mom and my dad. I think that will come up. I think it's something that I want to think about when I'm doing it because it would be nice to maybe get a bit of fresh perspective on it.

TH-001  
Okay, yeah.

PA-001  
Especially when I'm looking at, like the job that my dad did as a father. And like, it'll be a nice lessons learned exercise because there are some things that he did really well. But like the rest of it, come on. 

TH-001  
Okay.

PA-001  
Have a day off. Could have been so much more. And I just think, wow, this is the the recent thing is my step brother has just gone to Sheffield Uni. And like he's only been there four weeks and my dads come up like three of those weeks and like, I went to Sheffield Uni, and it's not far from ____. He never, never really did the same. I just think fucking A, being a better father to someone who's not your child. I just think well, sometimes that hurts. 

TH-001  
Yeah, it would, yeah. That would.

PA-001  
It hurts. And like, <PERSON> gets really antsy about it, because and like when she says comments, I go <PERSON>, don't don't, you don't know all of the backstory. So don't don't get angry about it. Because there's no point. Like, I stopped doing that a long time ago. She's like how are you not annoyed about that? There's no need. So. And who's this, sorry, that he's been going to visit, what's, who?  Step brother.

TH-001  
Step brother.

PA-001  
So they got married last, or this year, earlier this year, but they've been engaged for like 10 years.

TH-001  
So your sister, your sister's--

PA-001  
Sorry, my Dad and my stepmom

TH-001  
Ah, right, okay.

PA-001  
Got married last year, this year, and engaged for like 10 years. So I've got, they both remarried.

TH-001  
Oh, so it's the, right okay, okay. Yeah. 

PA-001  
But that's my dad's son, step son. 

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
Who's just come out. For the last 10 years, we've call him gay boy <PERSON>. 

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
So from about the age of about 12 I knew he was gay, he told me at the wedding, and I was like, no, really! Shocker. 

TH-001  
Yeah. 

PA-001  
I said I've known for about 10 years man. But he's really nice. There's no, there's no hatred or anything.

TH-001  
Yeah, it's not him because it's not his fault, it's more it's more like being a bit pissed off at your Dad.

PA-001  
It's just the theory of it, the principle. Yeah. 

TH-001  
Yeah. 

PA-001  
So and then I wonder how how much involvement my dad will have being a grandfather. That's a big thing. 

TH-001  
Yeah, it is a big thing. 

PA-001  
The support networks massive. I slightly resent my mom and my dad for not helping me as much. Like maybe financially and emotionally, I suppose. Everything I've done, I've done from scratch, really. And like, everything I've earned is is me. And like <PERSON>'s had quite fortunate, her parents are not, they're not got wealth at all. But they've got--

TH-001  
Giving your last penny, sort of people. 

PA-001  
Yeah. 

TH-001  
Do you feel, so apart from the sister being a bit annoying, do you feel fully integrated into <PERSON>'s family? Like with her parents and stuff? 

PA-001  
Yeah. 

TH-001  
Good. 

PA-001  
Yeah, but I don't think it's reciprocal on my side to <PERSON>.

TH-001  
Yeah. So you don't, she's not fully integrated with your family, but you are with hers?

PA-001  
I mean I don't think they're fully integrated with each other. They like the theory of it.

TH-001  
But it's not in practice.

PA-001  
They're nice, and they care. But the closeness and connection will never be there because I don't think <PERSON> respects them. So how can you, how can you have a relationship based on distrust? 

TH-001  
Yeah, of course. 

PA-001  
All that expectation. Whereas, like, <PERSON>'s mom and dad recently have been quite complimentary of me to other people, and it's filtered back inadvertently. I went to get a hair cut at their hairdresser they've gone to for like 15 years, and he said, your mom says <PERSON> has been fantastic. He's been very good. And very helpful. And he's doing like, yeah, did she say that? And he was just like, Yeah. There's a couple of times when <PERSON>'s dad's just like, hey, leave <PERSON> alone. 

TH-001  
That's nice. 

PA-001  
It is nice, but he can be a cock. 

TH-001  
Okay.

PA-001  
He can. It's just he's just old school, he's an old school banker. And like, he comes from that slightly more flashy, not flashy, flashy is the wrong work. But he's just got more expectation and doesn't give her credit. Doesn't really sympathize, but when it's her sister, fucking he'll stop the moon. It's like, just double standards, I hate double standards, shouldn't exist. And that's that's what I've got with my sister. It's like she caused hell, but I get the shit for all the family because she's not here. She's all oh you gotta go see grandma <PERSON>, because she's gonna die soon. I'm like, well, where are you? Across on the other side of the world, you dick. So it's like, there's like there's such such a rich backstory. It couldn't be in like 12 episodes of EastEnders.

TH-001  
It's like the omnibus? [Laughs]

PA-001  
The malady. So that's, I don't really know what I would do if I could have a bit of a revalation in that area, like what would it do? Sisters still not here, she's still mental, it's just nightmare. You can't reason with a madman. So I can clarify my thoughts about it. But in practice, where does that go? 

TH-001  
Yeah. 

PA-001  
Where's the end goal? 

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
I had a few times through the years where I've reasoned with my mom and dad, and like, their problem I've realized is they don't want to accept any fault. Any fault at all. It's undeniably other people all the time.

TH-001  
A bit narcissistic, then, are they?

PA-001  
It's very, very difficult to speak to them, because you can't level with them. They're just--

TH-001  
And when you try to then does it kind of go more into an argument, because it's like.

PA-001  
Very defensive. Very defensive. [Immitates defensive noises]

TH-001  
Okay. 

PA-001  
Just be honest with yourself. Take some responsibility.

TH-001  
So when you try and express, you don't feel like it can get you anywhere, because it's just like.

PA-001  
Brick wall. It's a brick wall of like mental people. They just don't, like it's just so frustrating. You try and it goes nowhere. You just, it's a fruitless task, isn't it. Don't bother. Put my energy into my family and <PERSON>'s family. If you get nothing back, what would you do? Would you keep doing it? I haven't got time for that shit.

TH-001  
Well, let's hope you get some revelations about that. Maybe for your intentio instead of how can I be a good husband and father, it should be something around like the family I've come from and the family I'm creating. Because that would encompass both.

PA-001  
How not to do it, how to do it?

TH-001  
Well, no, not necessarily just like something, I'm trying to think about how I could word it. Yeah, or like, how can I learn from the family that I've come from to be the family I create, or something?

PA-001  
Like the origin of family, and like family development, family growth, and connectivity. Because I think, I had a chat with my mom yesterday. And she was like, when's the baby due again? I was like alright okay. I said, well, she goes oh, we'll have to arrange some time off work and come up. And I was like, well, I think we're gonna have the first week. Just us two. Because I think that's the done thing these days. She was like what? You can't have you're, yeah, I've got to see got to see the baby, you can't stop us. So she's going to use like, she's going to use my child as an emotional extortion tool. That's just what she does. She's she's just mental. She's really mental, like do you know what I mean, I don't say that lightly. She's just emotional extortion all the time. And like people are bargaining chips, and it's just weird. It's not like it's, you know, I see what she's there is fine. I'm not like, I'm not sleeping. But it's just it gets to you a bit? It doesn't get to me, it's just, well obviously, it does get to me, but it's just like a bit of an eye roll scenario. Do you know what I mean? It's just like, she's doing it again. She's so mad. She's so fucking mad, all the time. And like she doesn't, she doesn't listen. She just doesn't listen. I paid, paid for the gym for her Christmas present. It's expensive. Go. She won't listen. She's just, she'll like, she's quite fat, she had an operation to have her coronary artery cleared. I think she had like a mini stroke from her hip replacement operation because of that, so she had to come back. She's just in bad shape. She's in bad shape. And like, I got to the point where I was like, <PERSON>, you'll be dead within five years, if you don't do something, go to the gym. And she has been going a bit. But she just won't listen to anyone, I was like alright, you need to knock down your diet, you're diabetic, pre diabetic, whatever. So you need to, you're gonna fucking die, like, you're gonna come and look after my child or come and take your child out. And you won't be able to do anything, you won't be able to play, you won't be able to look after them, you won't be able to come on holidays with us, because you're just a big fat whale you can't do anything. I was like, do you not feel guilty for that? That's just, I can't deal with fat people. There's no need, just laziness and undisciplined, so undisciplined. Your 29 year old son is going through your finances. Sorting them out, saying this is bullshit. You need to do X, Y and <PERSON> in the next five years, otherwise, you're gonna have no house. Shouldn't be that should it? Shouldn't be that way around. Right? It's like, I'm being the parent. All the time. I'm being the bigger person all the time. I keep my mouth shut. So that's tiresome. It's very tiresome. So I think that definitely be looked at. 

TH-001  
Yeah, I think it will. 

PA-001  
Okay, yeah, but then it might not.

TH-001  
It might not. Sometimes the most expected things don't. Sometimes saying them out loud, sometimes people get worried that something's going to come up. And it doesn't necessarily need to, but they think it will. But by actively sort of trying to suppress it, you know, not saying about it, then the very actively like, oh, I better not, like come up then it makes it makes it makes it come up. But if you say it out loud, then it doesn't unless it needs to. So if it comes up, you've got it out in the air, if it needs to come up, it will come up. 

PA-001  
Because my, like I said before my my thoughts and my what was it called, my mantra.

TH-001  
The intention?

PA-001  
The intention, yeah. So my intention is so engrained in my head at the moment, because of what is going on. And that is my primary concern. Full stop. So but there's so many branches into that from her family, my family, I don't know, money, being working and being present and not missing stuff, all of that branches into it. And it's like, one big spaghetti bowl of oh, my god, do you know what I mean? So I mean, I'm not. I'm not scared of it coming up. And like, part of me hopes it does.

TH-001  
Good, okay. Well it might then. Yeah.

PA-001  
And I don't think there's anything like, majorly traumatic that I'm gonna relive because I feel like I'm quite resilient. But it's obviously bothered me a lot over the years. So, I mean, maybe it'd be nice to open, peek, and close the door on that, like, get into it, have a look around and literally close the door on that. And then maybe forgive my family and forgive myself for pushing them away a bit, maybe? 

TH-001  
Yeah

PA-001  
But maybe. Maybe not.

TH-001  
I think that's a good one to think about next time as well. I think it would be good idea to slightly reword the intention so that it brings both together. Especially if it's something that you want to work on, gain some sort of insight into, I think it would be good.

PA-001  
Just with it being at such a critical point with kind of being pregnant. This all snowballs into one now. 

TH-001  
Yeah. 

PA-001  
And you got one hit, you don't get to do it. You get to raise this child once. And if you're surrounded, like <PERSON> said, what if we go back to them for Christmas at some point. And it's just arguing and mind games and snarky comments. And like, that's not the <PERSON> of absolute fucking bullshit event at my house. That's why I've not been there for four or five years. So to bring your child into that, I just didn't, I don't want that for my child. Like, it's not fair. And I shouldn't have to put up with that.

TH-001  
Well, your whatever way you want to raise your child, it's up to you.

PA-001  
You don't want to toxic environment. 

TH-001  
No. 

PA-001  
I'm taking fatherhood very seriously. 

TH-001  
Okay, that's a good thing.

PA-001  
It's a privilege. Not like, what my best mates at work, he had four rounds of IVF. And nothing. What, with one miscarriage? It's not fair. He'd be the best dad ever. And it didn't happen for them. It's sad. And I've spoken to him on this during the, during my, he was like, I'm talking about this a lot, and I just want to know that everything's alright with you. He was like, don't worry about it. I would never, ever think that you should suppress being happy or whatever for my sake. Yeah, I just wanted to check. You don't want really to kill me and then cry. Plus he's being the godfather because he's minted. His father in law is the CEO of Procter and Gamble. 

TH-001  
Oh, really?

PA-001  
I'm just waiting for him to die so I can inherit all of it. Because he's had no children, like he's not, you know, he's contractor, so I'm saving it, I said, you're gonna adopt me then? Like, legally adopt me. And then that will be fine. He's like no, don't let all your inheritance go to the taxman. Give it to me. It's fine. Yeah, no he's a cool dude.  

TH-001  
Proctor and Gamble ____. Yeah, crazy.

PA-001  
Yeah, ___ I think. So that, I mean, that was back in like, the 50s. He's also a butterfly expert. But anyway, we digress. I was gonna say something about him. But, nope, gone.

TH-001  
Just that if you feel like, you know, you wouldn't take it for granted that you're going to become a father, because you've seen how, you know--

PA-001  
I've tried to feel like I'm as grounded as I can be. I used to be DJ when I was about 18 till the age of 23. So I went to Ibiza a lot. And you'd go, you go for like three months of the year. And then you do whatever. Ladies over there. There's other stuff, and yeah you'd have your phone and come home and go back to <LOCATION> or whatever. And then I started when I was 17 I started looking after a lad with cerebral palsy. He was wheelchair, alright, not dead severe, but I started looking after him. I've been looking after him for like 12 years now. Got me this watch. That's why I wear a ridiculous looking watch.

TH-001  
That's that's not too bad.

PA-001  
Just a reminder, I've got three of them. So it's just a reminder to like ground myself a bit. Because plus, you can tell a lot from the watch someone wears. I've got a sense of humor, and I don't take myself too seriously. Whereas people with like ridiculous five grand watches are just morons. Just checking if you've got a watch on. 

TH-001  
I've got an Apple Watch on. [Laughs]

PA-001  
Even worse. So like, there's been loads of like weird little milestones in my life where I try not to get carried away and used to always come back from <LOCATION>. And like, no matter how much like loved up euphoria you've got, peaking on whatever substance. You've come home and you get a big hug off him. And he's a year older than me. And you got a big hug off him, I would just be like, okay, it's not even close to what, you know, it's not even close. It's the best thing in the worlds. So I kind of feel like I've been like a mini father and best friends to him. ____ because he sends ___ every year. Been to <LOCATION>.

TH-001  
<LOCATION> brilliant.

PA-001  
I hated it. 

TH-001  
Did you, you hate it?

PA-001  
Every fucking second.

TH-001  
I won so much money there.

PA-001  
Did you? Awful. 

TH-001  
I think that was why I loved it.

PA-001  
How?

TH-001  
On slots, I actually won like $600 over the course of a few days.

PA-001  
A highly addictive personality.

TH-001  
On the <LOCATION> and <PERSON> ones mainly, I was obsessed with them, yeah, the seats all vibrated whenever you're a winner, cash out cash out!

PA-001  
Really? That's funny.

TH-001  
Free drink as well. And you can smoke inside, even ___ but you can smoke if you're sitting on the slot.

PA-001  
Crazy. 

TH-001  
Shows you what they're able to do if you're spending money.

PA-001  
God bless the desert. <LOCATION> isn't even in <LOCATION>, do you know that? It's not in <LOCATION>. 

TH-001  
I know. <LOCATION>, isn't it?

PA-001  
Yeah. I just like that fact. So yeah, I use it to ground me a bit. I went to <PERSON> when I was when I was 16.

TH-001  
Alright. 

PA-001  
So it's you know both the [whistles].

TH-001  
Yeah, I've never been.

PA-001  
Yeah you should go. That's a sober one. Don't do any psychedelics before you go. But like, yeah I went for my birthday. So I just like to try and bring it back. Do you know what I mean? Just ground yourself now again.

TH-001  
Yeah, of course. 

PA-001  
You get carried away. I think I've done that over the years to try and deflect from what's going on with my family and stuff. It's just see the mind wants to know something.

TH-001  
Do you still do a bit of mixing and stuff? Or did you just get the DJ out completely?

PA-001  
No need for it anymore. Doesn't need to be a part of my life.

TH-001  
What did did you use? Like vinyl?

PA-001  
At first. Yeah, and then I went to serato. 

TH-001  
Oh, <PERSON> ,Yeah.

PA-001  
I just saw them back last year. And I put a close on that part of my life.

TH-001  
With Serato did you use it with like the--

PA-001  
CDJs or vinyl.

TH-001  
Oh okay, yeah, good. Do you do any producing or just? Yeah. Did you?

PA-001  
Yeah, we have two tracks.

TH-001  
What what what type of music?

PA-001  
Like, tech, house, like dubstep a bit, it was when dubstep was just coming out. 

TH-001  
Oh, I don't like dubstep.

PA-001  
Well it's been done to death now. When it first came out that was revolutionary.

TH-001  
The only one I remember from back then, because all my mates like, good god over 10 years ago now, yeah like Caspa "Where's My Money," I quite like that but um 

PA-001  
But that was like I was just when it peaked into mainstream. House and Tech was good. It was good.

TH-001  
I'm into more like, now I'm more into like pretty pretty sort of heavy acid techno. Real bouncy, old bouncy techno and stuff like that. 

PA-001  
I don't really got much time to listen to music nowadays. It's sad.

TH-001  
I was mixing on 12 tens, I'm not great on it, I have a we midi controller, because it's just like from home. 

PA-001  
You are a fucking geek. You are, have you got a boyfriend?

TH-001  
My fellow got a set of 12 tens, so that's why I was up, and the <PERSON> mixer, so I was up.

PA-001  
Was it the deal?

TH-001  
But he's he's going to Serato as well because he's got he's got loads of vinyl, but he's going to Serato, no he's doing <PERSON> with vinyl. Well for me I have traktor pro 2 on my computer, and I had a wee numark omni controller, just the ___, just like ___, I would like to do that. 

PA-001  
Traktor and Ableton are able to quite good.

TH-001  
Yeah, Ableton is what I've made a few tunes on, as well. We call ourselves the Wafters, I made a happy hardcore tune and I have to sample it, but I'm the it's me in the smaples of it. And it's, but it's all like ___. I made like, do you know <PERSON>, the movie?

PA-001  
How long have you been with this fellow?

TH-001  
Two years.

PA-001  
Oh bless him. He's not fucked off yet. 

TH-001  
Yeah, no, no. He's in love with me. <PERSON> is like my favorite film ever.

PA-001  
It's a good film. 

TH-001  
And you use like the master programmer like as samples. I made it like sort a house tune? And it's really, oh I love it. So good.

PA-001  
Drop it in the playlist. 

TH-001  
So if you're gonna just get blacked or whatever, then set meetings together or something, it's kind of fun. I love it, it's a good, yeah it's a good laugh.

PA-001  
It is good. I played a few music festivals. And that was really good. I made out some tunes to like 4000 people's, it was quite--

TH-001  
What festivals?

PA-001  
Wakestock, and ___ in <LOCATION>, that was good. Played in like ___ and ___. 

TH-001  
Space, space, space. It was 2007 when I went to Ibiza. It was whenever I was just turned 18. 

PA-001  
That's about when I was. 

TH-001  
Yeah, Spave on Sunday was there, Amnesia on the Monday with <PERSON> and Cocoon.

PA-001  
Cocoon was fucking awsome. Did you ever go to Zoo Project? It's the abandoned Zoo.

TH-001  
No. Yeah, I was gonna go, but we didn't end up going, I think we ended up in ___, somewhere, ____. [Laughs]

PA-001  
So let's focus back.

TH-001  
So how do you think about, do you have anything else you want to discuss? Or do you feel happy enough? Or?

PA-001  
I feel happy enough. It's probably good that we've gone through a bit of that stuff.

TH-001  
I think so yeah. Definitely. 

PA-001  
Yeah, I think so. 

TH-001  
Good.

PA-001  
I've got a lot of surrogate father and mother figures in my life as a result of it, which is good. I do wonder how it will change my interactions with the family. But when you go in with like good intention, and then nothing back, that might be weird. mht be a bit disheartening after the whole process, then we've got Christmas, haven't we. So that'll be a nice, maybe a nice tester, dip your toe in. Because that's intense time with people that you wouldn't really normally spend time with.

TH-001  
Well, let's hope whatever happens next time, if it if that does come up, it'll be more with regards to how you you accept them as what what they are. So no matter what way you feel afterwards, obviously, they haven't been through an experience. So it's not going to be like, they're not going to give a different reaction. So it'll be more by coming to terms with that's just who they are. And seeing then maybe a wee bit more peace with how you, how you interact with them. You know what I mean? 

PA-001  
Yeah maybe, more patience.

TH-001  
Yeah. And maybe not even trying to make it go a certain way. But just like, right, I can't do anything. But they're in my life, you know, they're my family at the end of the day, so I'll be there, but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let it piss me off.

PA-001  
I mean, you can't, you can't take take it for granted as well. Like my mom just lost her best friend. Two of her best friends really in the last couple years. So it just makes me think, well, what if I lost that? I'd be gutted. So like don't take it for granted. Do you know what I mean?

TH-001  
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. No matter no matter what, you know what I mean, it's, you get one mom. Yeah, it'll be more by coming to terms with, it'll be more by how you think about things, how you deal with things, and just accepting people for what they are. Whether it be you know, people on <PERSON>'s, whether it be you know, your own sister or your parents or whatever, how your dad's being all, it's just about, you know, coming to temrs with things. Closing that chapter and having a new one, right? So I'm not gonna cut them out in life, but I'm not going to, you know, I'm going to appreciate them for what they are sort of thing and just do things differently, do things my way when it comes to the family I'm creating. 

PA-001  
Because it is such a massive, like and I do think this has come at the perfect time because this is the biggest the biggest milestone, barring getting married. I have quite a long way. So it's gonna be really good, good, good. 

TH-001  
Someone coming in, I think it'll be <PERSON> actually. Good well, if you're happy with how things have went and everything that I'd just think of how to reword your intention in a like, all encompassing family you came from, family you're creating sort of thing. And then it's not really changing from what it was, but it's just bringing more in because obviously that's relevant. 

PA-001  
Yeah. 

TH-001  
So yeah, I'm not gonna keep you I let you get back to your hormonal pregnant wife. And you can let her know how things have went and yeah just when you're on the train or whatever, fill in those couple of questions, it will not even take you five minutes. Anything you need, text me or call me because I get so many emails per day. So just ring me. Well it could take me longer, because I tend to set aside like one day every now and again to just like, go through them all. So just send me a text or call me and if a can't answer just leave a voicemail, I'll ring you back. And apart from that, yeah, I feel like everything's going really well with you, so I don't really have any more hints and tips or anything, I'd just say, yeah, just you'll be fine, and I hope that you know, you get what you need, not what you want, as I said. Sometimes in this case, it could be need and something you need and that you want so that's a good thing. So yeah.

PA-001  
____, I think

TH-001  
Yeah. And it's good it's came this time. I'm glad that yesterday went the way I did because I think it's like the perfect stepping stone to a really good next session I'm not telling you. 

PA-001  
Do a lot of people get the big dose. 

TH-001  
Hm?

PA-001  
Do a lot of people get the big dose first? No? <PERSON> had a good game face then, a very good game face.

TH-001  
I'll give you, I'll give you information about how it was done afterwards. Do you want to go for a cigarette. 

PA-001  
Yeah. I need to cool off. 

TH-001  
Yep.
